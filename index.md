# Hi, I'm Armin

I am currently a Sophomore at UCSD doing **Computer Science**. Below you can find out more about me. To directly know about my internship experience, click [here](#interships).

This markdown is hosted on Github Pages and I hope this Lab has shown my proficiency in using the following Git Commands
```
git clone
git add
git commit
```

## Hobbies

I have a wide range of hobbies:

- I enjoy making music, primarily EDM and hip hop beats that I upload to soundcloud.
- I even occasionally DJ for events. For pictures of me DJing, [click here](./pictures.md).
- I also like to do graphic design on the side, which you can find on my instagram [@armout.jpg](https://www.instagram.com/armout.jpg/).

There are a couple more hobbies that I want to try when I get the time:

1. Game Design. I really want to learn how to use game engines like Unity and Unreal to make games
2. 3D Modelling and Animation
3. Start a side hustle

## Interships

I had recently interned as a **Software Engineer** for ***DataHinge***, where I worked on the backend of an online database that would aggregate all public data and records of housing properties in Florida. During my tenure, I was able to reduce OCR times for all the documents from 21s per document to about 3s using multiprocessing. I even set up the backend for our REST API that would produce realtime data for the properties.

In my experience, I learnt alot about multiprocessing, AWS, Docker and Express.js

## Goals

I have a couple of goals that I want to be able to complete within my 4 years of undergraduate studies

- [x] Obtain an internship at a startup
- [ ] Obtain an internship at one of the Big 4
- [ ] Attain some sort of research experience with faculty

## Conclusion

I am very excited to take CSE 110 given my experience that I hope I can share with my peers and also continue to learn from the Professor and others in the class.

I will, as well, always follow the motto given to us by the faculty:

> Start early, start often
